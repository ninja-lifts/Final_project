# Final_project
This project focuses on building a hand sign recognition model capable of identifying alphabetic gestures using Machine Learning (ML) and MediaPipe, a powerful framework for hand landmark detection. The model is designed to process real-time video input, detect hand gestures, and classify them into corresponding alphabetic characters.
